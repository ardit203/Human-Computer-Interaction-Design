# Lab exercise 1
## Django `Models` and `Admin Panel`
Create a Django application for managing books, which will allow adding, editing, deleting, and viewing books, as well as managing their genres, authors, and translators. Each book should have a title, author, genres, publication date, the user who added it, number of pages, book cover, and information about whether it is currently available for reading. Genres are defined with a name and description, where adding and deleting them is only allowed for superusers. The user who adds a book is automatically assigned as its owner based on the logged-in user, and only that user can edit or delete the book. The system should also record translators for the books, where one translator can work on multiple books, and a book can have multiple translators. For each translator, the name, nationality, and birthdate should be stored. Books can also receive ratings from users, where each rating contains the user, the rating, and a comment, and only the user who left the rating can delete it. Furthermore, books should be filterable based on their availability for reading.
